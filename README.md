# DeepLearningFromScratch

This repository is meant to be a scratch pad for me to implement Deep Learning Frameworks from scratch and document my progress on my Medium blog. Check it out here: https://medium.com/@ashaychangwani

The first post is about implementing Linear and Logistic Regression from scratch. 

The second will be about implemting CNNs using just NumPy.

Following that, I am yet undecided between some Image Classification frameworks and real-world projects using the topics taught in the course (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
